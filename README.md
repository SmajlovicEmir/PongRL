# PongRL
This is a short and simple implementation of the Classic Pong Game with an RL approach.
Please do read the Jupyter Notebooks to get further clarifications on methods. 
I have switched the model from Stable-Baselines to Keras, in order to train it, also the models and the environment has been
updated to support newer version of Keras and Gymnasium.
