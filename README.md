# PongRL
This is a short and simple implementation of the Classic Pong Game with an RL approach.
Just wanted to test out Stable Baselines 3, I trained the model but ran out of disk space.
The model is pretty simple, it's a classic pong game, with the twist that the agents opponent is a wall.
Make sure to remember to register the environment in stable baselines 3 so you can actually run it.
Unfortunately due to time constraints it does have a PyGame dependency, but it could also be easily made with OpenCV. 
I have also added a class in which you could adjust in order to train the model yourself, but do keep in mind that the parameters would need some tweaking.
