    "The most part of this code is explained through coments, I will just make a brief detour on certain choices that I made in making this. The rewards in this model are especially sparse, the ball moves two pixels per frame, the width of the PyGame window is 800px. Assume the model has managed the get a hit on the ball, the width of the paddle, and the dummy paddle is 10px each, therefore the total distance it has to travel is 780 pixels front and back. That means that the model has to wait for 390 frames in order to get a negative or positive reward. \n",
    "\n",
    "That lead me to the decision of decreasing the sparsness of the rewards. The way I have done that is by giving a the model a +1 reward if the ball is within the top and the bottom y-coordinate of the paddle, otherwise a -1 reward is returned. Also everytime the model manages to get 21 bouncebacks I give it a huge rewards in order for it to learn to get 21 consecutive bouncebacks at least."
